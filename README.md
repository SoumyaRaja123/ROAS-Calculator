# True ROAS Calculator

A simple tool to calculate the true Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) by accounting for new buyer discounts that Meta and Google analytics don't include in their calculations.

## 🎯 Purpose

Meta and Google's ROAS calculations don't account for discount costs given to new buyers, which makes their reported ROAS appear higher than reality. This calculator helps you:

- See your true ROAS when including discount costs
- Understand how much Meta/Google overstate ROAS
- Make better campaign performance comparisons
